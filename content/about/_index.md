Hello!, my name is Mari패a Jose패 Molina-Contreras.

During my PhD in Biotechnology at the Universidad de Barcelona, I developed strong analytical skills due to the amount of data I was extracting, manipulating and analyzing, from which it was crucial to get the key insights for my research.

I mainly used Excel for all the studies over these datasets, but also other complementary tools related to Biotechnology. Complementary to my studies, I have been driven by all the new technologies, languages and tools related to Data Science, so I started to learn by myself Python and SQL, from a couple of online courses with real world projects, from which I managed to get really good results.

After almost one year, I started to feel the need to make the next step, which is being a part of a team of people, that wants to make a difference in the world, by mixing technological and data analysis aspects.

## Employment

I designed and executed experiments to understand physiological behaviour of
plants in light competition conditions.
I studied the behaviour interactions based on physiological, proteomics and
genomics analysis.
The objective was understanding the molecular mechanisms which modulate the
**Shade Avoidance Syndrome** (SAS) and shade tolerance responses.
I contributed to the understanding of the role of the **protein ATHB4**,
implicated in SAS responses.
Furthermore, I identified to PHYA (**phytochrome A**, an important plant
photoreceptor) as a genetic component involved in conferring shade tolerance
in some plants.
